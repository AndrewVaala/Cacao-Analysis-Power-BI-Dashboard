## Overview

This project explores global artisan chocolate ratings through an interactive Power BI report. Using data on chocolate bars, companies, and cocoa content, the analysis uncovers trends in quality perception and market dynamics.

# Data_Source
This data was a group project at Blossom Academy.

# Tools_and_Skills
Microsoft Excel: This was used for initial data loading and cleaning, transforming the raw dataset into a structured format suitable for analysis. 

Power BI: Employed for the main analysis and data visualization, enabling the extraction of key insights through DAX measures and visual tools.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)


# Skills_Demonstrated
This analysis involved multiple data processing and analytical techniques, including:

* Data Extraction & Transformation: Converting PDF data and cleaning it in Excel.

* Data Processing & Cleaning: Structuring messy data using Power Query.

* Data Analysis & Quick Measures: Creating meaningful insights with DAX measures in Power BI.

* Visualization & Reporting: Presenting findings in a clear and actionable format.

* Critical Thinking & Problem-Solving: Identifying key trends and opportunities.

# Data_Processing
Data Transformation:
Several steps were taken in Power Query (PowerBi) to ensure the data was clean and well-structured:

Data types were standardized.
The first row was promoted to headers for consistency.

Data Preparation in Power BI:
After loading the cleaned data into Power BI, the following transformations and enhancements were made:

Date column breakdown: The day, month, and year were extracted to facilitate time-based analysis.

# Objectives

* Evaluate the overall rating distribution to understand perceived chocolate quality.

* Identify top-performing companies consistently producing highly rated bars.

* Examine the relationship between cocoa content (%) and ratings.

* Compare chocolate ratings across geographic company locations (U.S., France, U.K., etc.).

The cacao analysis reveals notable trends in the artisan chocolate market based on ratings, bean origins, and cocoa content:

Top-Performing Makers
Soma leads the market with 47 highly rated chocolate bars, followed by Bonnat, Fresco, and Pralus. Overall, French and North American brands dominate the top-tier ratings.

Overall Quality and Cocoa Content
The average rating across all brands stands at 3.38 (on a 1–5 scale), reflecting generally favorable quality levels. The average cocoa content is approximately 72%, aligning with the popularity of dark chocolate in the premium market.

Bean Type Insights
Chocolate made from Forastero (Nacional) beans achieved the highest average rating (3.3), while Forastero (Arriba) beans performed lowest at 2.8. This suggests that bean type plays a significant role in perceived quality.

Cocoa Content and Ratings Relationship
Ratings remain relatively stable (3.0–3.3) across cocoa content ranges (65%–85%), indicating that cocoa percentage alone is not a strong driver of perceived quality. Other factors, such as sourcing, roasting, and processing, likely have a greater influence.

Geographic Trends
Companies from France, the United States, and Canada consistently outperform others, highlighting regions with strong expertise and brand reputation in the artisan chocolate market.

Key Analysis
Overall Performance
A total of 1,038 chocolate bars from 60 company locations were reviewed, with an average rating of 3.19 (on a 1–5 scale), reflecting a generally satisfactory market quality.

Rating Distribution

Satisfactory chocolates dominate the market, accounting for 69.42% of all ratings.

Disappointing products make up 24.07%, indicating inconsistency in product quality across some brands.

Only 8.5% of chocolates fall into premium or elite categories, showing limited penetration of top-tier quality products.

Geographic Insights

Companies from Italy, Canada, and France lead with the highest average ratings (3.3).

The United States (3.2) and the United Kingdom (3.1) follow, confirming the dominance of North American and European regions in premium chocolate production.

Trends Over Time

Average ratings show a steady upward trend from 2.99 in 2008 to 3.41 in 2017, indicating an improvement in chocolate quality or better alignment with consumer preferences over time.

Market Quality Insights

While the market demonstrates a strong baseline of satisfactory quality, there is significant room for growth in the premium and elite segments. Brands that innovate in flavor, sourcing, and production quality could capitalize on this gap.





# Key_Insights



* Average rating: 3.19 (scale of 1–5) → Most ratings cluster between 2.75–3.50.

* Cocoa percentage: ~71.7% → Majority of bars are dark chocolate (70–75% cocoa).

* Quality perception: Ratings tend to be relatively high, hinting at either genuine quality or review bias.

* Market concentration: A few North American and European companies dominate the dataset.

* Global sourcing: Bean origins highlight the diverse international supply of cacao.

# Recommendations

* For Chocolate manufacturing Companies:

**Focus on quality over quantity:** Since most ratings cluster between 2.75–3.50, improving consistency and flavor profiles could help brands stand out.
Experiment with cocoa content: Explore beyond the common 70–75% range to identify niches in premium or milk chocolate segments.
Differentiate sourcing: Highlight unique bean origins (e.g., single-origin marketing) to attract consumers seeking authenticity.

* For Cocoa Supply chain or Industry Stakeholders:

**Promote diversity in the market:** Encourage smaller or emerging brands, especially outside North America/Europe, to reduce market concentration.
Educate consumers: Provide more transparency on bean origins and production processes to influence quality perception.

* For Future Research/Analysis:

**Deeper sentiment analysis:** Pair ratings with consumer reviews to capture qualitative insights.
Geographic preference mapping: Compare consumer preferences by region to align product offerings.
Trend monitoring: Track shifts in cocoa content popularity (e.g., growth in low-sugar, vegan, or specialty bars).
