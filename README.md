## Overview

This project explores global artisan chocolate ratings through an interactive Power BI report. Using data on chocolate bars, companies, and cocoa content, the analysis uncovers trends in quality perception and market dynamics.

# Data_Source
This data was a group project at Blossom Academy.

# Tools_and_Skills
Microsoft Excel: This was used for initial data loading and cleaning, transforming the raw dataset into a structured format suitable for analysis. 

Power BI: Employed for the main analysis and data visualization, enabling the extraction of key insights through DAX measures and visual tools.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)


# Skills_Demonstrated
This analysis involved multiple data processing and analytical techniques, including:

* Data Extraction & Transformation: Converting PDF data and cleaning it in Excel.

* Data Processing & Cleaning: Structuring messy data using Power Query.

* Data Analysis & Quick Measures: Creating meaningful insights with DAX measures in Power BI.

* Visualization & Reporting: Presenting findings in a clear and actionable format.

* Critical Thinking & Problem-Solving: Identifying key trends and opportunities.

# Data_Processing
Data Transformation:
Several steps were taken in Power Query (Microsoft Excel) to ensure the data was clean and well-structured:

Data types were standardized.
The first row was promoted to headers for consistency.

Data Preparation in Power BI:
After loading the cleaned data into Power BI, the following transformations and enhancements were made:

Date column breakdown: The day, month, and year were extracted to facilitate time-based analysis.







# Objectives

* Evaluate the overall rating distribution to understand perceived chocolate quality.

* Identify top-performing companies consistently producing highly rated bars.

* Examine the relationship between cocoa content (%) and ratings.

* Compare chocolate ratings across geographic company locations (U.S., France, U.K., etc.).

Key Analysis

Top Performing Makers

Soma leads significantly with 47 top-rated bars, far ahead of competitors like Bonnat (27) and Fresco (26).

French and North American brands dominate the highest-rated categories.

Overall Quality Levels

Average cocoa content: ~72% (aligning with dark chocolate preference).

Average rating across all makers: ~3.38 on a 1–5 scale, indicating generally favorable quality but room for differentiation.

Bean Type Insights

Forastero (Nacional) beans score the highest (3.3), followed by Trinitario (3.2) and Criollo (3.2).

Forastero (Arriba) shows lower ratings (2.8), suggesting potential quality or taste perception issues.

Cocoa Content vs. Rating

Ratings remain relatively stable (3.0–3.3) across cocoa levels from 65% to 85%.

This indicates cocoa percentage alone doesn’t strongly influence quality perception; other factors like bean type or processing quality likely matter more.

Geographic Trends

Companies from France, the U.S., and Canada consistently feature in the top tier.

European makers generally edge slightly higher in average ratings compared to others.

Key Analysis
1. Overall Performance

Total Chocolate Bars Reviewed: 1,038 from 60 company locations.

Average Rating: 3.19 (on a 1–5 scale), showing generally satisfactory quality in the artisan chocolate market.

2. Rating Distribution

Satisfactory: 69.42% (773 bars) dominate the dataset.

Disappointing: 24.07% (288 bars), indicating quality inconsistency in nearly a quarter of products.

Premium & Elite: Only 8.5% combined, signaling limited presence of exceptionally high-rated chocolate bars.

3. Geographic Insights

Top-rated regions:

Italy, Canada, and France lead with average ratings of 3.3.

The U.S. follows with 3.2, and the U.K. trails slightly at 3.1.

This suggests European and North American makers dominate the premium quality spectrum.

4. Rating Trends Over Time (2006–2017)

Ratings have shown overall improvement:

Lowest average: 2.99 (2008).

Highest average: 3.41 (2017).

This indicates a steady enhancement in chocolate quality or better alignment with consumer preferences over time.

5. Market Quality Insights

The high proportion of satisfactory but not premium ratings suggests a market with consistent but not exceptional quality.

Opportunities exist for brands to innovate and elevate products into the premium and elite categories.





# Key_Insights



* Average rating: 3.19 (scale of 1–5) → Most ratings cluster between 2.75–3.50.

* Cocoa percentage: ~71.7% → Majority of bars are dark chocolate (70–75% cocoa).

* Quality perception: Ratings tend to be relatively high, hinting at either genuine quality or review bias.

* Market concentration: A few North American and European companies dominate the dataset.

* Global sourcing: Bean origins highlight the diverse international supply of cacao.

# Recommendations

* For Chocolate manufacturing Companies:

**Focus on quality over quantity:** Since most ratings cluster between 2.75–3.50, improving consistency and flavor profiles could help brands stand out.
Experiment with cocoa content: Explore beyond the common 70–75% range to identify niches in premium or milk chocolate segments.
Differentiate sourcing: Highlight unique bean origins (e.g., single-origin marketing) to attract consumers seeking authenticity.

* For Cocoa Supply chain or Industry Stakeholders:

**Promote diversity in the market:** Encourage smaller or emerging brands, especially outside North America/Europe, to reduce market concentration.
Educate consumers: Provide more transparency on bean origins and production processes to influence quality perception.

*For Future Research/Analysis:

**Deeper sentiment analysis:** Pair ratings with consumer reviews to capture qualitative insights.
Geographic preference mapping: Compare consumer preferences by region to align product offerings.
Trend monitoring: Track shifts in cocoa content popularity (e.g., growth in low-sugar, vegan, or specialty bars).
