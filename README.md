# Objectives

Evaluate the overall rating distribution to understand perceived chocolate quality.

Identify top-performing companies consistently producing highly rated bars.

Examine the relationship between cocoa content (%) and ratings.

Compare chocolate ratings across geographic company locations (U.S., France, U.K., etc.).

This data was a group project at Blossom Academy.

# Key_Insights

Average rating: 3.19 (scale of 1–5) → Most ratings cluster between 2.75–3.50.

Cocoa percentage: ~71.7% → Majority of bars are dark chocolate (70–75% cocoa).

Quality perception: Ratings tend to be relatively high, hinting at either genuine quality or review bias.

Market concentration: A few North American and European companies dominate the dataset.

Global sourcing: Bean origins highlight the diverse international supply of cacao.

# Recommendations

For Chocolate Companies:

Focus on quality over quantity: Since most ratings cluster between 2.75–3.50, improving consistency and flavor profiles could help brands stand out.
Experiment with cocoa content: Explore beyond the common 70–75% range to identify niches in premium or milk chocolate segments.
Differentiate sourcing: Highlight unique bean origins (e.g., single-origin marketing) to attract consumers seeking authenticity.

For Industry Stakeholders:

Promote diversity in the market: Encourage smaller or emerging brands, especially outside North America/Europe, to reduce market concentration.
Educate consumers: Provide more transparency on bean origins and production processes to influence quality perception.

For Future Research/Analysis:

Deeper sentiment analysis: Pair ratings with consumer reviews to capture qualitative insights.
Geographic preference mapping: Compare consumer preferences by region to align product offerings.
Trend monitoring: Track shifts in cocoa content popularity (e.g., growth in low-sugar, vegan, or specialty bars).
