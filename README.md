## Overview

This project explores global artisan chocolate ratings through an interactive Power BI report. Using data on chocolate bars, companies, and cocoa content, the analysis uncovers trends in quality perception and market dynamics.

# Data_Source
This data was a group project at Blossom Academy.

# Tools_and_Skills
Microsoft Excel: This was used for initial data loading and cleaning, transforming the raw dataset into a structured format suitable for analysis. 

Power BI: Employed for the main analysis and data visualization, enabling the extraction of key insights through DAX measures and visual tools.

Data visualization & storytelling.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA).


# Skills_Demonstrated
This analysis involved multiple data processing and analytical techniques, including:

* Data Extraction & Transformation: Renaming columns and cleaning the  datat in Excel.

* Data Processing & Cleaning: Structuring messy data using Power Query.

* Data Analysis & Quick Measures: Creating meaningful insights with DAX measures in Power BI.

* Visualization & Reporting: Presenting findings in a clear and actionable format.

* Critical Thinking & Problem Solving: Identifying key trends and opportunities in the chocolate market.

# Data_Processing
**Data Transformation**

Removed duplicate records to ensure unique entries for each chocolate bar.
Eliminated rows with missing or invalid ratings, cocoa percentages, or company names.
Standardized inconsistent text formats (e.g., trimming spaces, correcting spelling errors in company or bean origin names).
Converted numeric fields like Rating and Cocoa Percentage from text to numeric for accurate calculations.

**Data Preparation in Power BI**

After loading the cleaned data into Power BI, the following transformations and enhancements were made:
Created calculated column for Rating Category (e.g., Satisfactory, Premium, Elite) based on rating thresholds.

# Objectives

* Evaluate the overall rating distribution to understand perceived chocolate quality.

* Identify top performing companies consistently producing highly rated bars.

* Examine the relationship between cocoa content (%) and ratings.

* Compare chocolate ratings across geographic company locations (U.S., France, U.K., etc.).

The cacao analysis reveals notable trends in the artisan chocolate market based on ratings, bean origins interms of both country and region and species, and cocoa content in their finished products:

Top-Performing Makers
Soma leads the market with 47 highly rated chocolate bars, followed by Bonnat, Fresco, and Pralus. Overall, French and North American brands dominate the top-tier ratings. The average rating across all brands stands at 3.38 (on a 1–5 scale), reflecting generally favorable quality levels. The average cocoa content is approximately 72%, which indicate that dark chocolate is more preferred  in the premium market.

Bean Type Insights
Chocolate made from Forastero Nacional beans achieved the highest average rating of 3.3, while Forastero Arriba beans performed lowest at 2.8. This suggests that bean type plays a significant role in perceived quality. Companies from France, the United States, and Canada consistently outperform others, highlighting regions with strong expertise and brand reputation in the chocolate market.

Cocoa Content and Ratings Relationship
Ratings remain relatively constant around  3.0–3.3 with cocoa content ranging from 65% to 85%, indicating that cocoa percentage alone is not a strong driver of perceived quality. Other factors, such as sourcing, roasting, and processing, likely have a greater influence.


Companies from France, the United States, and Canada consistently outperform others, highlighting regions with strong expertise and brand reputation in the artisan chocolate market.


**Cocoa Quality Overview**

  A total of 1,038 chocolate bars from 60 company locations were reviewed and the average rating of 3.19 on a 1 to 5 scale . This indicates clearly a general satisfaction with the various chocolate products by the various brands. 

  A large portion of the chocolates products on the market about 69.42% were deemed as satisfactory by the customers. However, almost a quarter of the chocolate products about 24.07% had been reviewed as being less than satisfactory. This is still a relatively high number.
Also only 8.5% of chocolates fall into premium or elite categories.

  Companies from Italy, Canada, and France lead with the highest average ratings of 3.3 and these all happen to be European companies which reflects the long history of chocolate making in these countries. Companies from  United States had an average rating of 3.2  and those from the  United Kingdom had an average rating of 3.1 .

  Average ratings show a steady upward trend from 2.99 in 2008 to 3.41 in 2017, indicating an improvement in chocolate quality or better alignment with consumer preferences over time. While the market demonstrates a strong baseline of satisfactory quality, there is significant room for growth in the premium and elite segments. Brands that innovate in flavor, sourcing, and production quality could capitalize on this gap.


# Key_Insights


* The average rating of all chocolate products analysed was 3.19. Most chocolate bars are rated between 2.75 and 3.50, showing that the market delivers consistent, the diststribution of rating was between the mid range to high  section with very little extreme variations.

* The averate cocaa percentage in finished products were 71.7%. Majority of the products analyzed  fell within the 70–75% cocoa range, indicating a strong preference for dark chocolate among both producers and consumers.

* The generally high ratings suggest either consistently good quality or potential review bias, where products are rated more favorably than they objectively deserve. But the still room for improvement with the quarter of unsatifactory reviews.

* A handful of North American and European brands dominate production and high ratings, highlighting a competitive but concentrated market and also a history of chocolate manufacturing in their culture. The diversity in bean origins shows that the cacao supply chain is highly international, with beans sourced globally but often processed by companies in key regions.

  

# Recommendations


* Chocolate manufacturing Companies would have to focus on quality over quantity. Since most ratings cluster between 2.75 to 3.50, improving consistency and flavor profiles could help brands stand out. Companies also have to experiment with cocoa content to explore beyond the common 70 and 75% range to identify niches in premium or milk chocolate segments. There should be products made from single sourced origins which can be promoted in their marketing material to  attract consumers seeking authenticity.


*  Cocoa Supply chain and industry stakeholders would have to promote Forastero Nacional beans in the market. Encourage smaller or emerging brands, especially outside North America/Europe, to reduce market concentration. Also provide more transparency on bean origins and production processes to influence quality perception.


* There  is a need for more analysis and scientific research to find what make the Forastero Nacional beans type the bean with the highest rating among customers and how the climate in which it is grown plays a role in its qualities. There is also need to obtain data on the age segment who patronize the various chocolate products to help ascertain their purchasing motives .
